# Invoice-Processing-using-RPA-and-Generative-AI
---
A tool to automate the processing and extraction of structured data from invoices.

## About
---
Manual invoice processing is error-prone, time-consuming, and hinder operational efficiency. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with OCR and Generative AI promises enhanced efficiency, precise text extraction, seamless Excel integration, and error reduction, addressing these challenges effectively.

## Features
---
- Error Reduction: RPA, OCR, and Generative AI minimize errors in manual invoice processing.
- Time Efficiency: Streamlined processes save time and boost operational productivity.
- Precise Text Extraction: OCR and Generative AI ensure accurate data capture from diverse formats.
- Seamless Integration: Smooth data transfer and Excel integration enhance workflow efficiency.
- Cost-effectiveness: RPA reduces labor costs and improves overall operational cost-efficiency.
